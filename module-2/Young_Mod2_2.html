	<h2>Chapter 1: About me</h2>
	<p class="intro"><span class="sentence">Hey, my name is Javonta Young and I am a US Air Force Veteran.</span> My job in the Air Force was an Integrated Avionics Specialist. Which means I am very diverse in radios and navigation systems on planes</p>
	<p>With being in the Air Force, I found a passion for computers.What led me to that passion were all the people that had pc's and I had no clue what that was.So, I went out to by my first pc and that took me down a great path.</p>
	<p>My first pc got me into streaming which I found I was extremely good at. But once I found out I was having my son, all games had to be put away.So, after I put them away I found my love for the gym again and wanted to learn more about computers. </p>
	<p>So, now I am currently enrolled at Bellevue University, which I am so pleased to have the best professors ever. My son is now 1 and we have moved to my dream state and my wife home state of California to be closer to family. My bodybuilding coach is out here too so I felt like this was the best move to make.</p>
